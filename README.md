# Nearest Moustache Property API

This project is a backend API built with **FastAPI** to help tele-callers quickly find Moustache properties within a **50km radius** of any city, state, or area in India. It integrates a fast LLM using **Groq** to smartly extract locations from natural-language queries and uses Redis to cache results for fast responses.
